 Hey there! 👋 I'm Tanuja

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm just getting started with coding and version control, and this space is where I’ll be learning, experimenting, and (hopefully!) building some cool things.

🌱 A bit about me

I'm currently learning the ropes of Git and GitHub, along with brushing up on my programming skills. I'm super curious about how things work under the hood, and I love figuring things out one line of code at a time.

💻 What I’m Learning

- Git & GitHub (of course!)
- Python / C / SQL
- HTML & CSS
- Basics of software development and debugging

 🔧 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is still a work-in-progress — much like me 😄 — but soon you’ll see:
- Practice projects
- Notes from what I’m learning
- Small experiments and maybe a few bugs 🐞 (the friendly kind)
